# storemyresults_CST
This project was done as a part of partial completion of internship under Compsoft Technologies.

The project "storemyresults" was intended to store and search the results stored by students.

Essentially it is supposed to be one stop solution to store access and do all CRUD options and get statistics for the results let's say in 4 years of Bachelor's degree or any other program that could span few years.

The project is simple PHP application with HTML, CSS and Vanila JavaScript and can be run on server like Xampp.
